# Texture CSV 

This is a small addon to export all image paths from a blend file into a csv. This paths can be manipulated in a software like Excel and be reimported to change the actual image paths of the blend file. The second functionality is to automatically create a material nodetree for every material in the scene. This is currently destructive and applies to all materials! Why should I need that?!

I was working on a project with over 800 texture files and simply lost the overview. I didn't have the time to spend a lot of energy and time into creating a fancy tool inside of blender itself. Beeing able to export it to excel made it much easier to keep an overview, check for missing textures and change file path.

I wrote this small addon especially fot the purpose of one single project. I wanted to be abble to quickly change texture resolutions and texture files. It was never designed to be really flexible. Nevertheless, I decided to publish it here as it really saved my life.
